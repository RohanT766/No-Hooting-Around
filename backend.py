    # Construct the prompt
    prompt = f"Given to you is a screenshot of the user’s current activity on Chrome. Your job is to determine the current productiveness of the user based off of the content they are viewing, and more specifically the relevance to their stated goal in this work/study session: “{goal}”. Consider how the webpage could lead to productivity: for example, being on Google Drive could be used for essay writing or for messing around. Youtube can be used for educational content or for video game walkthroughs. For websites with multiple uses, give the user the benefit of the doubt unless it is clear that they are misusing the site. You must be harsh, but not overly harsh. Take for example if the user’s goal is to study calculus and the screenshot shows them watching a video about F1 or texting about video games on Instagram, you may be confident in your assertion that the content on screen is unproductive and irrelevant. However, if the contents of the webpage are vaguely related in some way to the user's goal, then you must exercise a lesser level of confidence. You must return a number from 1-100 representing the percentage of confidence you have that the user is off task. Reply with only that number and nothing else.".strip()
